Within the body of the filter you can then define one or several of the following interceptor types for the filter:

* @before@ - Executed before the action. Can return false to indicate all future filters and the action should not execute
* @after@ - Executed after an action. Takes a first argument as the view model
* @afterView@ - Executed after view rendering.  Takes an Exception as an argument. Note: this closure is called before the layout is applied.

For example to fulfill the common authentication use case you could define a filter as follows:

{code:java}
class SecurityFilters {
   def filters = {
       loginCheck(controller:'*', action:'*') {
           before = {
              if(!session.user && !actionName.equals('login')) {
                  redirect(action:'login')
                  return false
               }
           }

       }
   }
}
{code}


Here the @loginCheck@ filter uses a @before@ interceptor to execute a block of code that checks if a user is in the session and if not redirects to the login action. Note how returning false ensure that the action itself is not executed.
