h1. validate

h2. Purpose

Validates a domain class against the applied constraints (see [Validation|guide:validation])

h2. Description

The @validate@ method will validate a domain class based on its defined [constraints|guide:constraints]. The errors will be stored within the [errors|domainClasses] object.

The @validate@ method accepts an optional @List@ argument which may contain the names of the properties that should be validated.  When a @List@ is passed to the @validate@ method, only the properties defined in the @List@ will be validated.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
def b = new Book(title:"The Shining")
if( !b.validate() ) {
   b.errors.each {
        println it
   }
}
{code}

{code:java}
def a = new Album(artist: "Genesis", title: "Nursery Cryme", releaseDate: 1971)

// only validate title and releaseDate
if( !a.validate(["title", "releaseDate"]) ) {
   a.errors.each {
        println it
   }
}
{code}

Parameters:

* @deepValidate@ (optional) - Determines whether associations of the domain instance should also be validated, i.e. whether validation cascades or not. This is @true@ by default - set to @false@ to disable cascading validation.
